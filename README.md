# Dust scattering and extinction

#### Calculate dust scattering and extinction from the ultra-violet to infrared with the use of the Rayleigh-Gans/Mie scattering models and the grain-size distributions (Mathis, Rumpl & Nordsieck 1977 and Weingartner & Draine 2001) in the Milky Way, Large Magellanic Cloud and Small Magellanic Cloud.
